    "in pregnancy length between first babies and others, so a natural choice\n",

    "between first babies and others; that is, that pregnancy lengths for\n",
    "both groups have the same distribution.\n",

    "- The third step is to compute a p-value, which is the probability of\n",
    "seeing the apparent effect if the null hypothesis is true. In the NSFG\n",
    "example, we would compute the actual difference in means, then compute the probability of seeing a difference as big, or bigger, under the\n",
    "null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The last step is to interpret the result. If the p-value is low, the effect\n",
    "is said to be statistically significant, which means that it is unlikely\n",
